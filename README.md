# web-project-portfolio

This Project was my first attempt at a Portfolio page for my work. It was written at a time when i was very new to coding and only had a basic knowledge of HTML, 
CSS and SCSS. It's quite basic but I hold it quite dear to myself, I felt a real sense of achievement at seeing what i could create at such an early stage of
my learning journey.

It's currently in the state of a template and I intend to keep it that way as I've since created a portfolio in React.

This project should run straight out of the box as long as you have VSCode installed to load it into.
